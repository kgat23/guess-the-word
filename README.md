# guess-the-word

Hello to everyone who is reading this.

Guess the Word is a game that has been made to improve your English vocabulary. It has 20 levels, in which the meaning of the word will be given and based on that you have to guess what the word is. In order to help the players, some of the letters in the middle will be given. You can also use hints (there are 3 hints available per game) which will tell the number of letters present in the left as well as right parts of the word. If you give the correct answer, it will show that you have cleared the level and you can move on to the next level. If you give the wrong answer, it will give which part/s (left or right or both) is/are wrong. You have to finish 20 levels, in order to complete the game.

Rules:
There will be 20 levels, which will progressively get harder.
In each level, you will be given the meaning of a particular word.
You will also be given some letters present in the middle of the word.
